How to use this sneaky bro and things to keep in mind:
    
    When running the first section your whole workspace gets cleared (thanks mum)

    The Data is not included to the distribution and needs to be copied manually in the main folder (no file-feeding no classification-cheering!).
    the following subfolders are suggested: rootfolder/Data/training ... in the training sub-folder are alle the .wav files which include Stereo Audiostream AND THE REFERENCE.CSV !!!11111

    You're now pretty much ready to roll.

Export model manually from the Classification Learner:
    in the current workflow the trainedmodel is generated manually using the Classification Learner
    and the trained model has to be exported manually with the exact name "trainedModel".

Results and Quality of Outcome:

    Any averaged Confusion-values below 90% of the prediction model are considered a failure by the law of the pirate-codex and shall be discarded without further explanation.
